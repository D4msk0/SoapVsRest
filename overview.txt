Project Overview

This project is a Java 17 Spring Boot application that demonstrates the usage of both SOAP and REST endpoints.

1. **SOAP Endpoint:**
   - Purpose: Illustrates the usage of SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) for web services.
   - Dependencies:
     - `spring-boot-starter-web-services` for Spring WS support.
     - `saaj-impl` for SOAP with Attachments API for Java.
   - Usage: The SOAP endpoint can be accessed at `/soap` and provides a basic SOAP web service.

2. **REST Endpoint:**
   - Purpose: Demonstrates the usage of REST (Representational State Transfer) for web services.
   - Dependencies: Included by default with the `spring-boot-starter-web`.
   - Usage: The REST endpoint can be accessed at `/api` and provides a simple RESTful API.

When to Use SOAP:
- Use SOAP when strict standards and protocols are required.
- Useful in enterprise environments with existing SOAP-based systems.

When to Use REST:
- Use REST for simplicity, flexibility, and lightweight architectures.
- Preferred in modern web development and microservices architectures.

Feel free to explore and experiment with both endpoints to understand the differences and choose the appropriate web service style for your specific project needs.
